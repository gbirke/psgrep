To install, just execute ./install.sh.  If you wish to install psgrep somewhere
other than /usr/local/bin, set the $PREFIX variable like so:
PREFIX=/usr sudo ./install.sh
The default $PREFIX is /usr/local

If you, for example, install psgrep to your home directory, don't forget to set
your PATH to include "~/bin" as well as your MANPATH (or ~/.manpath) to include
"~/share/man".
