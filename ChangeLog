1.0.3:
* Updated license to GPLv3.
* New run-time option, -p, for Perl regular expressions.
* New man page!
* Updated install script to use bash as well as to install the man page.

1.0.2:
* Since Ubuntu changed /bin/sh to dash instead of bash, I've realised that
this does indeed use bashisms.  Thereform, I have changed the shell to use
/usr/bin/env bash instead.

1.0.1:
* Doesn't show itself in process list.

1.0:
* Initial release.
